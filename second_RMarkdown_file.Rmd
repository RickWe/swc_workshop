## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r is_2007 <- gapminder$continent == "Africa" +
is_Africa <- gapminder$year == 2007 +
africa_2007 <- gapminder[is_2007 & is_Africa, c("country", "lifeExp")]}
```
## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~continent) }
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
