```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
source("code/gapminder_utilities.R")
```

This is a report describing changes in life expectancy over the last 60 years as it relates to GDP and other variables.

```{r load_data, echo=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

The gapfinder dataset contains `r ncol(gapminder)` variables from `r nrow(gapminder)` observations.

I was blown away by these results.

```{r facet_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.path="figures/"}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~continent)
```

```{r GDP}
calcGDP(gapminder, country = "China")
calcGDP(gapminder, year=2002, country = "China")
```
